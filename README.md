# Seasonal-Catalog-Mix-Predictor
WGU CS Capstone - ML Application

  This is my Capstone project for the WGU Computer Science program in 2025.
  It is a machine learning solution that looks at (simulated) historical shopping trends and predicts a future ratio of clothing categories to develop a product mix ratio for a print catalog.
  The solution itself is contained in a Google Colab notebook.  The solution uses Python for the primary programming language and SciKitLearn for the machine learning models.
